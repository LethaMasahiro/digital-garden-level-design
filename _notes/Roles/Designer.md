### Description: 
Designers are one of the most crucial roles in the level design process as they shape many decisions and make use of the methods and tools provided in this vault. Level designers are responsible for creating game environments, challenges, and experiences that engage players, guide them through the game world, and provide meaningful interactions. They work closely together with the other roles in different stages of the level design process.

- Layout of the level
