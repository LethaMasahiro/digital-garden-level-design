## Description

A Blockout refers to a preliminary, rough or non-final version of a game level or environment that is created by using simple, placeholder assets and basic geometry. The primary purpose of a blockout is to establish the layout, scale, and flow of a level before investing significant time and resources in creating detailed graphics, models, or other assets.
