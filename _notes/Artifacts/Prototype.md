## Description

A prototype is an early, simplified, and often incomplete version of a game, level, or specific game mechanic. Prototypes are created to test concepts, gameplay and mechanics. They are crucial for game development as they discover bugs and difficulties early in the process while they give the developers a more tangible vision of the game. 

Beware that a [[Blockout]] is also a Prototype, but it focuses on the spatial layout while a prototype can cover and test multiple fields. 

## Concrete Examples

- A level prototype made in Unreal Engine with [this](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/prototools-level-prototyping-toolset-open-source/119575) toolset (beware that this is also a [[Blockout]] as long as it tests the spatial layout of the level)

- A Vertical Slice: A demo of the game that includes elements from various fields like gameplay, graphics, and key features.
