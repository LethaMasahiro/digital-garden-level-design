## Description

A Hypergraph is a more complex type of graph structure used to represent relationships between elements in a game or level. Unlike traditional graphs, which consist of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, a hypergraph allows for connections that involve multiple nodes. Hypergraphs are employed when the relationships between game elements are more intricate or when elements can belong to multiple groups or categories simultaneously.
