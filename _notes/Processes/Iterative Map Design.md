## Classification
#process 

## Intent

- Build a detailed map of the level.
- Improve upon older map designs.
- Constantly update the map.

## Problem

### General

- Any product goes through different steps of production (see [[Software Engineering Workflow]]).
- Designing comes before the actual development/prototyping.
- However, in the production phase, the limits of the product are discovered, and sometimes the product's design has to be changed.
- Agile Development focuses on iterations (Agile Manifesto).

### Specific

- Iterative design integrates feedback from other designers, team members, and external playtesters.

## Process Steps

Iterative Design according to Zimmermann:

#### Step 1: Draw a Map

- Create a first draft of your [[Map]] that shows every important element you want to include.
- You can refer back to the [[Drawing a Map]] method to get an idea of how to draw a level map.
- Relevant roles: [[Designer]], [[Roles/Artist]].
- Tools: [[Digital Art Tools]], [[Non-digital Design Tools]].

#### Step 2: Test

- Test your first draft of the map by [[Gamespace Prototyping]] the layout, meaning that you build the layout of the map with simplified mechanics and forms.
- This will result in a prototype of the level.
- A map can also be tested without a prototype. Instead, you can test the map by merely discussing it with other designers who have different insights into the level.
- Relevant roles: [[Designer]], [[Engineer]].
- Tools: [[Game Engines]].

#### Step 3: Analyze

- Discuss what you found out in the Prototyping step or while discussing the map with each other.
- Identify what works and what doesn't work in the layout.
- Also, consider the pacing (can be analyzed in a [[Pacing Diagram]]) and how the map enforces the pacing you imagined.
- Document your findings to keep in mind what needs to be changed.
- Relevant roles: [[Designer]].

#### Step 4: Refine

- Refine the map by taking into account all the points that need to be changed.
- Draw the refined map with more detail, at some point considering metrics as well.
- Relevant roles: [[Designer]], [[Roles/Artist]].
- Tools: [[Digital Art Tools]], [[Non-digital Design Tools]], [[Computational Tools]].

#### Step 5: Repeat from step 2

- Iterate over the process until you're satisfied with your findings.

## Applicability

- Similar to prototyping your overall level, iterating over your map is an important step to discover problems early on.
- It's a design step, but the map is still updated during the development phase.
- Consider how many loops you want to do as they cost money and resources.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros**:

- Find problems early on.
- Keep your map updated with your ideas and findings.
- Problems get smaller and smaller with more iterations.

**Cons**:

- Need to spend more time and resources on iterations.
- Might be difficult to make a loop/iteration meaningful and truly realize its potential (Schell 2014).

## Related Processes

- Can be done in parallel with [[Game Development]] during the pre-production, production, and testing phases.
- [[Combat Design]] can also be taken into consideration with the map design.
- [[Gamespace Prototyping]] of the level uses the material created in the iterative map design as well.
