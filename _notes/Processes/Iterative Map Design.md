title: Iterative Map Design
---

also known as: 

## Classification
#process 

## Intent
- Build a detailed map of the level 
- Improve on older map designs
- Constantly update the map

## Problem

### General
- Any product goes through the different steps of production (see [[Software Engineering Workflow]])
- Designing comes before the actual development/prototyping
- But in the production phase the limits of the product are discovered and sometimes the design of the product has to be changed
- Agile Development focuses on iterations (Agile Manifesto)
### Specific
- Iterative design integrates feedback from other designers, members of the team and exernal playtesters 
- 

## Process Steps


Iterative Design according to Zimmermann: 
#### Step 1: Draw a Map
- Create a first draft of your map that shows every important element you want to show
- You can refer back to the [[Drawing a Map]] method to get an idea on how to draw a level map
- Relevant roles: [[Designer]], [[Artist]]
- Tools: [[Digital Design Tools]], [[Non-digital Design Tools]]

#### Step 2: Test
- Test your first draft of the map by [[Prototyping]] the layout, meaning that you build the layout of the map with simplified mechanics and forms
- This will result in a prototype of the level
- A map can also be tested without a prototype. Instead, you can test the map by merely talking about it with other designers who have other insights on the level.
- Relevant roles: [[Designer]], [[Engineer]]
- Tools: [[Game Engines]], [[Computational Tools]]

#### Step 3: Analyze
- Talk about what you found out in the Prototyping step or while discussing the map with each other
- Point out what works and what doesn't work in the layout
- Also keep in mind the pacing( can be analyzed in a [[Pacing Diagram]]) and how the map enforces the pacing you imagined
- Write it down somewhere to keep in mind what needs to be changed
- Relevant roles: [[Designer]]

#### Step 4: Refine
- Refine the map by taking all the points that need to be changed into account
- Draw the refined map with more detailed, at some point taking metrics into account too
- Relevant roles: [[Designer]], [[Artist]]
- Tools: [[Digital Design Tools]], [[Non-digital Design Tools]]

#### Step 5: Repeat from step 2
- Iterate over the process until you're satisfied with your findings


## Applicability
- Just like prototyping your overall level, it's an important step to iterate over your map to discover problems early on
- It's a design step, but the map is still updated in the development phase
- Think about how many loops you want to do as they cost money and resources

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- Find problems early on
- Keep your map updated with your ideas and findings
- Problems get smaller and smaller with more iterations

Cons:
- Need to spend more time and resources on iterations
- Might be difficult to make a loop/an iteration meaningful and really get its potential (Schell 2014)

## Related Processes
- Can be done in parallel with [[Game Development]] during the pre-production, production and testing phase
- [[Combat Design]] can also be taken into consideration with the map design
- [[Prototyping]] the level takes the material created in the iterative map design as well
