##### Description
Discord is a social platform emphasizing on the gaming community. It can be used in a rather casual context for communication with instant messages, voice calls, video calls and file sharing. It can be accessed online on a webbrowser or through apps for multiple operating systems.

##### Features: 
- Servers are a collection of channels with different titles, allowing a group of users to share their thoughts to different topics in different channels.  Servers can be verified by game developers, publishers, e-sport teams and music artists to create a platform for players and fans to seek guidance, fun or community. The servers can be joined by with a link.
- It is possible to create text channels and voice channels. In text channels, people can send instant messages, voice messages and share files. In voice channels, people can join and leave on their own account, talk to each other, share their screen, their video or use the streaming feature. The channels can be made public or private for only a specific group of people to see them. They can also be grouped into categories that can be made public or private as well.
- Threads are temporary text channels that can be opened on a message to start a conversation. These threads are hidden in the regular chat but pinned to the original message to avoid the chat to become overvrowded and unorganised. They can also help in a channel that focuses on answering questions.
- In addition to a username and profile picture, Users can personalize their profile by adding an "About Me" section.
- Live streaming allows a user to share their screen or a window and people in the same voice channel can choose to watch the stream.
