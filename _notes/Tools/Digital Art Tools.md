##### Description: 
Adobe Photoshop is a popular graphics tool among designers not only in the game development field but across industries to the point that it even influenced our culture by integrating the word "photoshopped" to define pictures that look like they have been edited. It is known for its versatile toolset for photo manipulation but has become increasingly popular in digital art as well. It can also edit 3D graphics and video. Photoshop is a paid application that can be downloaded and installed to your local machine.

##### Features: 
- Raster graphics
- Manipulate pictures: Erase certain objects from the picture, replace and extend backgrounds, manipualte the colors, add text, edit the quality with filters and lighting conditions
- Create a blank canvas and draw on it with various template and custom-made brushes
- Create textures with brushes, templates and photo manipulation tools
- Edit videos and 3D graphics
- Plugins increase the versatily of the program

##### Payment: 
Photoshop is part of Adobe's abonnement model and has the following options:
- Photoshop Plan (20.99$ /month)

##### Keywords:
#3DModels #animation #visualeffects #simulation


##### Description: 
Blender is a 3D computer graphics software focusing on the creation of 3D models, visual effects, simulations and animations. It is a free open-source software that can can be downloaded and installed on your local machine. Its results can be exported into industry standards and imported to [[Game Engines]] like Unity or Unreal Engine

##### Features: 
- Modeling
	- Subdivision of surfaces to control the amount of polygons in the model and its level of detail
	- Sculpting
	- Geometry nodes to create and control geometry (connect the nodes with lines in the editor)	  
- Simulation of fluids and cloth
- Animation, also 2D animation even though it's in a 3D pipeline
- Includes three render engines that are supported through CPU or GPU. The rendering includes shadows, hair, volume, subsurface scattering, baking etc.
	- Materials can be added and manipulated in the node editor to define the lighting conditions and volumes.
- An integrated Rendering Pipeline that enhances the performance of complex projects, including Post-Production with a non-linear video editor
- Plugins or addons and scripts can be added to expand and customize the functionality

##### Payment: 
Blender is free to use.

##### Roles:
- [[Artist]]

##### Keywords:
#3DModels #2Dmodels #assets #textures #painting

##### Description: 
ZBrush is a digital sculpting tool that specializes in high-resolution 3D and 2.5D modeling. It also includes texturing and painting but focuses on sculpting masses in contrast to the approach of other traditional digital art tools. Companies like Epic Games and EA use ZBrush to model high-resolution models. The resulting meshes can be exported in industry standard files to [[Game Engines]] like Unity or Unreal Engine.

##### Features: 
- 3D Brushes customize the modeling experience and allow for unique shapes.
- Polypaint allows the user to paint on a surface by directly adding color to the polygons.
- 2.5D brushes allow the user to illusrate on a flat surface.
- Transposing allows the user to move isolated parts of the model without the need to rig the model.
- ZSpheres are copied from a simple sphere to create a complex model.
- A full Preview Render lights the scene and manipulates the lighting according to the needs of the user.
- Add and manipulate large parts of models with DynaMesh and Fibermesh.
- Reduce or increase the polygons in the model or in parts of the model with ZRemesher. 
- Shadowbox allows the user to draw a shape in a virtual box. Any changes to the drawing are applied to its 3D model. 
- 3D models can be exported into 2.5D models.

##### Payment: 
The following payment options are available:
- 32.69€/month for just ZBrush
- 112.64€/month for a bundle containing Maxon's products Cinema 4D, Forger, Red Giant, Redshift, Universe and ZBrush
