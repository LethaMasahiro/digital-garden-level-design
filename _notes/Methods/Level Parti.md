- #tools/digital #tools/non-digital 

## Intent

- Rapid idea generation.
- Early determination of map designs and flows.

## Problem

### General

- Need to develop the spatial layout of a building or space.
- No need for precise measurements; a quick sketch is enough.

### Specific

- Need to design the spatial layout for a level.
- Want to define key milestones or objects within the level before creating a detailed map.

## Solution Approach

### General

- Sketch an architectural parti.

### Specific

- Sketch your gameplay ideas as spatial diagrams, referred to as level design partis.

## Application

### Input

- A clear idea of the elements or appearance you want in your level.

### Application

- Quickly create multiple sketches of the object or space.
- Draw from various perspectives, explore different variations, and experiment with different lighting conditions until you find a version you like (or multiple versions).
- Do not concern yourself with precise measurements.

### Output

- One or several level partis depicting the object or level you intended to sketch.
- [[Sketch]] or [[Drawing]].

### When to use it

- Prior to mapping.
- At the start of the design process when you are beginning to refine your ideas.

### Relevant Roles using this model

- #roles/designer [[Designer]] #used-by/designer
- #roles/artists [[Roles/Artist]] #used-by/artist (if they have creative freedom to design the world).

## Relevancy in the following processes

- [[Game Development]] in the Design and early Development phase.
- [[Combat Design]] for cover and spatial design.
- Used before [[Iterative Map Design]] to get an initial idea of the map.
- Useful in [[Gamespace Prototyping]] when you want to explore and brainstorm about what to create.

## Applicability

- Ideal for stimulating idea generation and getting started.
- Can be useful when you're feeling stuck.
- Not suitable for later development stages where designs must adhere to specific measurements and guidelines.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros**:

- Quick creation of multiple partis.
- Helps find your creative flow when generating many ideas.
- Effective for exploring alternative designs.

**Cons**:

- Lack of precise measurements.
- Limited to sketches; the final design still needs to be constructed.
- Not a substitute for creating a full map, but rather a preliminary step.

## Relation with other Methods

- [[Drawing a Map]] serves as an initial step and a solid foundation for drawing a map.
- [[Nintendo Power Method]] can provide a basis.
- [[Axonometric]] can apply measurements and scale to the drawn objects.
- Real-world references collected in the [[Reference Collection]] can help depicting objects close to reality.
