## Classification
- #method 
- #medium/visual #medium/diagram 
- #roles/designer #roles/artists 
- #used-by/designer #used-by/artist 
- #tools/digital #tools/non-digital 

## Intent
- Form ideas quickly
- Decide early on map designs and flows

## Problem

### General
- You want to develop the spatial layout of a building or space
- No consideration of correct measurements needed, just a quick sketch

### Specific
- You want to develop the spatial layout for your level
- Before creating a map, you want to define the important milestones in the level or the objects filling out the level

## Solution Approach

### General
- sketch an architectural parti

### Specific
- sketch your gameplay ideas as spatial diagrams, called level design parti

## Application

### Input
- A specific idea of what elements you want in your level or how your level should look like

### Application
- Quickly draw many many sketches of that object/space
- Draw from different perspectives, in different variations, with different lightning conditions until you find a version that you like (or multiple versions)
- Don't take measurements into account

### Output
- One or several level partis of the object/level you wanted to sketch
- [[Sketch]]

### When to use it
- Before sketching the map 
- Right in the beginning of the design process when you start concretizing your ideas

### Relevant Roles using this model
- #roles/designer [[Designer]] #used-by/designer 
- #roles/artists [[Artist]] #used-by/artist if they have enough freedom to design their world

## Relevancy in the following processes
- [[Game Development]]
- [[Combat Design]] for covers and spatial design
- Used before [[Iterative Map Design]] to have an idea about the map
- [[Prototyping]] when you want to understand and brainstorm on what to create

## Applicability
- Perfect to get the ideas flowing and start somewhere
- Might also be helpful if you're stuck
- Unfit for later development stages where every design has to fit in the environment with its measurements and concrete guidelines

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- Quick to draw many partis
- Easy to find one's flow when drawing many
- Good exploration method to find alternative designs

Cons:
- No measurements
- Only sketches so it still has to be built and put into place
- Not an alternative for building a map but rather an extension

## Relation with other Methods
- [[Drawing a Map]] as a first step and good base to draw a map from
- [[Nintendo Power Method]] as a base

## Examples
- Sketches of electric fence traps in SWARM!
