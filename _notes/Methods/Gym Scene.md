## Classification
- #method 
- Prototype
- Testing
- Level
- Digital

## Intent
- get a practical overview of your level
- test your metrics, character controller, mechanics
- How does it look like? Did you make the right use of space?

## Problem

- You have a concept of your level and want to test it
- The mechanics are already defined as well as your gameplan and the layout of your level

## Solution Approach

- Use a gym scene to test what you planned and designed
- Test if everything works as you planned it and if it fits your imagination
- 

## Application

### Input
- A map (not necessarily?)
- assets
- Game beats and [[Nintendo Power Method]] (not necessarily a linear pacing graph because you want to test how a character moves and test the spatial relations)

### Application
- Build a level in your [[Game Engines]] of choice, doesn't have to look like your planned level but should include all important elements of your gameplay
- roughly define the blocks and objects as obstacles, interactables or other important elements
- Try to play the character and challenge the metrics and mechanics to find bugs as early as possible

### Output
- A platform with objects that you can use for testing what you had in mind
- Different variations of your mechanics, e.g. different platforms for different jumping techniques, moving platforms

### When to use it
- For testing your mechanics and ideas

### Relevant Roles using this model
- #roles/designer 
- #roles/engineers 
- collaboration between these

## Relevancy in the following processes
- [[Game Development]] Panning, Production and Testing Phase (I think)

## Applicability
- it's not an actual level! So don't use it when you want to create your level from a map, rather use it to test the limits of your mechanics and get new ideas that stretch these mechanics

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- Very fast way to have something practical that you can test because you don't need assets and it doesn't have to look pretty
- find bugs and limitations early
- but also find other possibilities that you haven't thought of until now

Cons:
- Not an actual level, so it's limited to its functional analysis
- Hard to test storyline with it and gameplay beats, use it more as an actual gym to explore and test
