  "_Lovecraft immerses you in an atmospheric action game full of twists and turns as you discover tools that help you reach a towering castle with a potion that could save the world from decay. As you progress and explore the crumbling world around you, cockroaches, ants, and scorpions guide you toward the castle and help you uncover what caused the once-vegetated world to begin to darken before your eyes. Catered toward action-adventure fanatics and played on PCs, Lovecraft takes around 10 hours to beat and includes non-linear gameplay, with various options to capture the potion to win._"
