## Intent
- capture something that serves as a reference to your own work
- gain inspiration
- also for coordination and communicating your idea just like mood boardstake key characteristics from real-life examples/ game references/ etc. and create your own perfect mixture
- 

## Problem

### General

### Specific
- just like mood boards
- start somewhere
- You see something that gives you inspiration, just like a specific game scene or concept art that gives you ideas (e.g. the Western setting in "Westworld" (Amazon Prime) can inspire you for a futuristic robotic setting in Texas)
- You read an inspiring line in a book that makes you think about human ethics and human rights in terms of AI (I don't have a reference for this lol)
- You want to share it with your team and save it for future use

## Solution Approach

### General

### Specific
- start a collection with all your inspiration from other media
- doesn't have to be visual or audible, can also be text, feelings, experience written down, anything that gives you inspiration for your level
- should be able to convey your idea so it has to be feasible in some way

## Application

### Input
- any reference you found
- can be: paintings, sketches, sounds, music, text, books, papers, textures, movie scenes, diaries, quotes, pictures of reallife nature, literature on history, ...

### Application
- collect all the references in one place
- can be a collection of different assets
- you can also create a board with it just like mood boards or you can leave it as separate assets, e.g. in a folder structure
- Can aso be technical references (e.g. free-to-use code) (can it though?)
- Can also be mockups

### Output
- said [[Collection]]
- can be shared

### When to use it
- when you don't know where to start
- whenever you find something that ispires you
- can be used in [[Game Development]] planning, designing, also developing and testing phase and in all the iterations to add details to your level and flesh it out
- Can be documented in a [[Game Design Document]]

### Relevant Roles using this model
- #roles/designer #roles/artists #roles/engineers 
- #used-by/artist #used-by/designer #used-by/engineers #used-by/manager (to pitch the idea to investors/ outside of the team)

## Relevancy in the following processes
- [[Game Development]] planning, designing (implementation and testing)
- [[Prototyping]] what's your game about

## Applicability
- just like [[Mood Boards]]: As a communication and coordination tool, but focusing on creativity, inspiration and freedom
- it's just a reference so don't copy it 1:1
- in contrast to mood boards, it's not limited to visual and audible cues but can be anything, more creative freedom, less "finished" and polished, can also be more abstract

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- It's always good to store references and come back to it so you don't lose yourself in the process of creating, but rather come back to it in the game development process
- Inspiration can strengthen your creativity
- Widen your horizon
- the more references you have, the closer it is to reality (or your vision in general)
- communication and coordination tool
- not limited on visible and audible cues

Cons:
- More abstract than mood boards
- Not everyone understands why you chose a certain reference, can seem random to add it to the collection and can be confusing
- Nowhere near a finished product, but should serve as inspiration instead
