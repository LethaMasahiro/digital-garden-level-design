## Intent

- To capture a reference for your own work.
- To gain inspiration.
- To facilitate coordination and communicate your ideas, similar to mood boards.
- To extract key characteristics from real-life examples, game references, etc., and create your own perfect mixture.

## Problem

- Similar to mood boards, you need a starting point.
- Sometimes, you come across something inspiring, like a specific game scene or concept art that sparks ideas (e.g., the Western setting in "Westworld"(2016) on Amazon Prime inspiring a futuristic robotic setting in Texas).
- You read an inspiring line in a book that prompts you to contemplate human ethics and AI's impact on human rights (even without a specific reference).
- You want to share these inspirations with your team and save them for future use.

## Solution Approach

- Start a collection with all your inspiration from various media.
- The inspiration doesn't have to be limited to visuals or sounds; it can also include text, feelings, experiences written down, or anything that inspires your level.
- The inspiration should be able to convey your idea feasibly in some way.

## Application

### Input

- Any reference you have found.
- This can include paintings, sketches, sounds, music, text, books, papers, textures, movie scenes, diaries, quotes, pictures of real-life nature, literature on history, and more.

### Application

- Collect all the references in one place.
- You can create a collection of different assets.
- You can organize it similar to mood boards or keep them as separate assets in a folder structure.
- It can also include technical references (e.g., free-to-use code), although this may be a rare case.
- Mockups can also be part of this collection.

### Output

- The enhanced [[Collection]] of references.
- It can be shared with others.

### When to Use It

- When you don't know where to start.
- Whenever you encounter something that inspires you.
- Can be used in various phases of [[Game Development]], including planning, designing, development, and testing, as well as during iterations to add details to your level.
- Can be documented in a [[Game Design Document]].

- [[Manager]] #used-by/manager (for pitching the idea to investors or external stakeholders)

## Relevance in the Following Processes

- [[Game Development]] planning, designing (implementation and testing).
- [[Gamespace Prototyping]] to define what your game is about.
- [[Iterative Map Design]] to find inspiration for your map.
- [[Combat Design]] to get inspired by other game's combat enemies, allies and mechanics.

## Applicability

- Similar to [[Mood Boards]]: serves as a communication and coordination tool, but with a focus on creativity, inspiration, and freedom.
- It's just a reference, so it should not be copied 1:1.
- In contrast to mood boards, it's not limited to visual and audible cues; it can encompass anything, offering more creative freedom and abstraction.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros**:

- Storing references allows you to revisit them, preventing you from losing track during the game development process.
- Inspiration can enhance creativity.
- Broadens your perspective.
- The more references you have, the closer you get to realizing your vision.
- Serves as a communication and coordination tool.
- Not limited to visible and audible cues.

**Cons**:

- More abstract than mood boards.
- Not everyone may understand why you chose a specific reference, which can make adding it to the collection seem random and confusing.
- It's far from a finished product; it should serve as inspiration instead.
