## Intent
- Motivate players to play further and look forward to playing the game
- Use rewards to keep the player's interest and attention
- Use Schedules to keep the rewards consistent
- Find a balance between the right amount of rewards (not too many and not too little)
- Lead player behavior

## Problem
- want to keep player's interest
- encourage them to play further and enjoy exploring the world

## Solution Approach
- instead of popping rewards randomly, think about using a consistent pattern to make players anticipate and look forward to rewards
- It's not always about the size and impact of a reward, but about the point in time when you get them

## Application

### Input
- An existing level (with an existent story structure maybe?)
- A plan on what rewards you want to place in the level

### Application
- There are two types of reward schedules which you can apply:
  
	- Ratio Schedule
		- Fixed Ratio: "reward is given after a fixed number of responses" (Nagle, Aniket et al. p.36 (reference 30)) (e.g. in Tetris you are rewarded each time after you fill a line)
			- gives you reliability and the player can expect the reward to integrate it into their strategies
		- Variable ratio: "a reward is given after an unpredictable number of responses" (reference 30) (e.g. in Monster Hunter world there is a random chance that a dead monster drops a rare resource)
			- Enforces excitement and is a stronger reward? (from the website)
			  
	- Interval Schedule (missing a reliable source)
		- Fixed Interval: A reward is given after a predefined amount of time (e.g. League of Legend: once per day you receive bonus exp and in-game currency for playing)
		  It doesn't matter how how many times the player completes an action within the interval since they only get the reward once per interval
		- Variable Interval: A reward is given after an unpredictable amount of time (example?)
		  as above, the player only receives the reward once per interval

- Decide which Schedule you would like to implement and plan your rewards according to the scheme
- You can also mix these types according to your personal preference

### Output
- A plan written down on paper or in a markdown file or anywhere you would like to write it down
- [[Document]]

### When to use it
- When you want to use rewards and plan them to structure your level better
- When you want to keep players engaged with rewards
- When you want to contrast your risks with rewards and balance both out

### Relevant Roles using this model

- #roles/player [[Player]]
- #used-by/engineers [[Engineer]]

## Relevancy in the following processes
- [[Game Development]] Design phase
- [[Iterative Map Design]]

## Applicability
- Nice to have a plan, especially in big levels where you need a lot of structure to keep the player motivated
- 

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- structure and having a plan
- good to follow through and test after it has been implemented
- you can mix the different types and achieve different player behavior

Cons:
- Needs various types of rewards
- there are only four types so it might be a little limiting?
- Need to think about different schedules for open-world, storyline-based, online etc.
- What is too obvious for the player? What is too hard to achieve? Find a balance

The use of player-centered positive reinforcement to schedule in-game rewards increases enjoyment and perfomance in a serious game (https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/101582/1/47-229-1-PB%282%29.pdf)
