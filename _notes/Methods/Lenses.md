## Intent
- Look at Game Design from different perspectives
- Focus on fundamentals
- Get inspiration from other fields and roles
- Think differently

## Problem

### General
- Sometimes designers get stuck in their own narrowed perspectives and need to gain more distance to the game to look at it from different perspectives
- How to find solutions for a problem you've been working on for hours/days and you don't have any idea on how to solve it
- How to gain knowledge from other fields and make your game more considerate and detailed

### Specific
- What applies for Game Design also applies for level design, just in a more detailed way
- How to find a solution if you are out of ideas?

## Solution Approach

### General
- Look at the problem from different perspectives
- Stick to your main ideas but get inspired and dare to experiment a little
- Try to come up with solutions by answering questions

### Specific
- Look at the design problem from different lenses

## Application

### Input
- Any decision, problem, or just an idea of a game

### Application
- Look at your problem through one of the many lenses introduced in the book by Schell: 
	- Look at the Table of Lenses and decide on any lense title that seems like it addresses your problem
	- Look up the page of the lense and read its definition
	- Apply this lense to your problem and try to come up with unique ideas by answering the questions suggested in the lens

### Output
- In the best case a solution for your problem
- Otherwise, the mere process of thinking through a different perspective/lense might be enough to widen your horizon

### When to use it
- When you need other perspectives
- When you're out of ideas
- When you're about to make a decision since the lenses are more philosophical and decision-based than concrete methods of designing a game

## Relevancy in the following processes
- none in particular, but it's nice to use lenses in parallel

## Applicability
- Enhances creativity and broadens one's view, so this method fits if you would like to try something new while sticking to your old paths at the same time
- decision-based, so there's no practical or computation-heavy lense

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- There are many lenses so chances are good that you find some that fits your use case or problem
- If you are open enough to new ideas you can broaden your horizon
- Can be used by one individual or the whole team
- Lenses can be adapted to individual use cases since they are more philosophical

Cons:
- It's only from the view of one author and therefore might be biased on their experiences
- It doesn't solve practical problems but rather encourages you to think
- There are many lenses to go through and it might take a lot of time finding the correct one for your problem

## Relation with other Methods
- none in particular since it's more of a concept than a concrete method

## Examples

Some lenses that can be applied to level design: 

- The Lens of Endrogeneous Value (p.43)
	- This lens is about the value of the level to the player. Think about which objects have which value to the player and which objects don't feel necessary to the player at all.
	- "A game's success hinges on the players' willingness to pretend it is important. To use this lens, think about your players' feelings about items, objects, and scoring in your game. Ask yourself these questions: 
	  - What is valuable to the players in my game?
	  - How can I make it more valuable to them?
	  - What is the relationship between value in the game and the players' motivations?"

- The Lens of Flow (p.148)
	- What lets the players focus in the level? Also see [[Pacing Diagram]] to improve focus
	- "To use this lens, consider what is holding your player's focus. Ask yourself these questions: 
		- Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?
		- Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?
		- Are there parts of the game that distract players to the point they forget their goal? [...]
		- Does my game provide a steady stream of not-too-easy, not-too-hard challenges, taking into account the fact that the player's skills may be gradually improving?
		- Are the player's skills improving at the rate I had hoped? If not, how can I change that?"

- The Lens of Reward (p.234)
	- Think about when and how your level rewards the player, also see [[Reward Schedule]]
	- "[...] Ask these questions to determine if your game is giving out the right rewards in the right amounts at the right times:
		- What rewards is my game giving out now? Can it give out others as well?
		- Are players excited when they get rewards in my game, or are they bored by them? Why?
		- [...] Do my players understand the reward they are getting?
		- Are the rewards my game gives out too regular? Can they be given out in a more variable way?
		- How are my rewards related to one another? Is there a way that they can be better connected?
		- How are my rewards building? Too fast, too slow, or just right?"

- The Lens of Atmosphere (p.431)
	- As a more artistic approach, think about how the level can convey a certain atmosphere. Also see [[Mood Boards]] and [[Reference Collection]]
	- "Atmosphere is invisible and intangible. But somehow it envelops us, permeates us, and makes us part of the world. To make sure the atmosphere or your world is properly intoxicating, ask yourself these questions: 
		- Without using words, how can I describe the atmosphere of my game?
		- How can I use artistic content (both visual and audible) to deepen that atmosphere?"
