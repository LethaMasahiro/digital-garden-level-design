title: Nintendo Power Method
---

## Classification
#method 
- #medium/visual 
- #tools/non-digital or #tools/digital 
- macro-level

## Intent
- Pace your level on a macro-level

## Problem

General and Concrete: 
- same as the pacing diagram since it's the same kind of creating an interesting level with important story points

## Approach/ Solution

- Nintendo Power method originated in the late 1980s in the game strategy and news magazine "Nintendo Power" (Totten, 2019, p. 82-84)
- They published maps of levels with important gameplay points marked as caption balloons (Totten, 2019, p.82-84 )
- Designed as an overview and highlight of important gameplay points
- Also important for game designers and developers since it's easier to analyze what's important to the player
- 

## Application

### Input
- Game beats
- Map of your level

### Application
- Combine the gameplay beats and mark them on the map
- Analyze if the gameplay points are to narrow/there's no time to breathe
-  If the points are populating the area too densely, you might reduce them to get more space into the level and let the player breathe

### Output
- A [[Map]] with beats marked in your level
- Spatial layout of your level

### When to use it
- Analyze the denseness of your level and what's important to the player
- Adding and removing story points

### Relevant Roles using this method
- #used-by/designer #used-by/engineers 
- #roles/player #roles/designer #roles/engineers (engineers correct?)
- [[Engineer]] [[Player]] [[Designer]]

## Relevancy in the following Processes
- Just like pacing graph
- [[Game Development]] Designing step after you already have a map
- Maybe also playtesting and post-development (iteration to improve since you can involve players)

## Applicability
- Good for spatial layout rather than having a timeline
- not good for pacing the time events (use linear pacing graph then)

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- spatial relations
- analyze what the player likes and is important to them
- get a sense of too densely packed areas
- add safespaces for exploration
- know about loopholes and shortcuts that players use

Cons:
- No timing relations
- A map is 2D and doesn't show vertical spacing
- Taking metrics into consideration can become too complicated and confusing for a map
- When to use? In design already or after implementation? If in design, have you already decided on a map? If after implementation, is there even time and the possibility to change your level?

## Relation with other Methods
- Sort of a [[Pacing Diagram]] but with focus on spatial relations
