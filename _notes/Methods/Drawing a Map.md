## Classification
#method
#medium/visual 
#process/designing 
#roles/designer #roles/artists
#used-by/designer #used-by/artist #used-by/engineers 
#tools/digital #tools/non-digital 
## Intent
- Spatial outline
- Planning objectives, objects, interactions, gates and challenges
- Figuring out where and how often to place rewards
- Get a sence of the space by accurately depicting the metrics
- 

## Problem
- Might already have a storyline
- A vision of what the map should look like
- A vision of the game aesthetic and the world the level/game is set in
- Know about characters (Player and NPCs) and mechanics

## Solution Approach

### Specific
- The map lol

## Application

### Input
- Same as Problem, this template is really hard to apply here

### Application
- just start drawing a map
- take other maps or reallife places as examples and references (add it to [[Reference Collection]])
- decide on 2D or 3D views
- Some helpful architectural drawing fragments that can be used:
	- Plan: top-down drawings of a space that show relations between hallways, buildings etc. -> Draw at least one plan for general overview of the level
	- Section: frontal drawing that shows the verticality of a level, can cut through buildings to show the different floors, often used in tandem with a Plan
	- Elevation: Also a frontal drawing but without cutting through buildings, instead viewing them from the outside, also used in tandem with the above
	- Axonometric: Cutting right through a building in 3D, not 2D,  to see the inside and the spatial relations
	- Perspective: Draw with a vanishing point to "develop the visual art of a level" (Totten, 2019)
- Draw as many maps as you like and don't shy away from throwing out some designs
- Iterate over them and improve the detail of the maps
- Possible to add Gates: seal or open entries over time
- Possible to use visual cues and symbols to visually highlight important elements or give the player tips


- An alternative approach of designing a map (Schell chapter 21):
	- Draw a space (any shape)
	- Divide the space into irregular sections
	- Comes close to a real map because of it irregularity
### Output
- many, many maps
- [[Map]], [[Sketch]]

### When to use it
- explore the spatial relations and the limits/possibilities of the level
- Find out where the character should start
- Storywise exploration, where to put which hints, where to add a challenge
- Decide on more story-based or open world gameplay
- Place the NPCs
- Find out how long the level will take to complete

### Relevant Roles using this model

- #roles/artists [[Artist]] #used-by/artist 
- [[Engineer]] #used-by/engineers 

## Relevancy in the following processes
- [[Prototyping]] Drawing a Map Step
- [[Game Development]] which step?

## Applicability
- a must for every game designer in the planning and designing phase
- also good for talking with artists and setting the mood of the level (adding details to the level)
- good for engineers to know where to implement the mechanics
- good testing base and map for the first prototype levels
- It's still only a concept and has to evolve over time

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- Planning
- Including artistic choices
- Spatial relations
- Pin down the metrics

Cons:
- Only a concept
- Need many drawings
- Can change over time

## Relation with other Methods
- [[Nintendo Power Method]] since it's based off a map
- Should be part of [[Game Design Document]]
- [[Reward Schedule]] should be included when planning the layout of the level
- [[Mood Boards]] as aesthetic inspiration for the map's looks
- [[Reference Collection]] as direct references for drawing the map and filling it with life
- [[Behavior Diagram]]: Marks how a player or other game object behaves within the map/level

## Examples

- still needs drawn maps!
