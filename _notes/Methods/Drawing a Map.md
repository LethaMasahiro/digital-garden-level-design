## Intent

- Spatial outline
- Planning objectives, objects, interactions, gates and challenges
- Figuring out where and how often to place rewards
- Get a sense of the space by accurately depicting the metrics

## Problem

- You might already have a storyline.
- You have a vision of what the map should look like, but you didn't draw it yet.
- You have vision of the game aesthetic and the world the level/game is set in, but you didn't connect it to the level layout yet.
- You know about the characters (Player and NPCs) and mechanics.
- You need to communicate your ideas to the team.

## Solution Approach

- Draw a map to visualize your ideas of the spatial layout of the level.
- Connect all the pre-work you've done (defining the characters, the aesthetic of the world, the narrative etc.) into one comprehensive map.
- The concept draws inspiration from architectural drawings. Take these architectural drawing types into consideration:
	- Plan: top-down drawings of a space that show relations between hallways, buildings etc. -> Draw at least one plan for general overview of the level
	- Section: frontal drawing that shows the verticality of a level, can cut through buildings to show the different floors, often used in tandem with a Plan
	- Elevation: Also a frontal drawing but without cutting through buildings, instead viewing them from the outside, also used in tandem with the above
	- Axonometric: Cutting right through a building in 3D, not 2D,  to see the inside and the spatial relations
	- Perspective: Draw with a vanishing point to "develop the visual art of a level" (Totten, 2019)

## Application

### Input

- Ideas and decisions about characters, mechanics, the spatial layout, the game world and its aesthetic, and the storyline.

### Application

- Draw a map. You can begin with the player paths, with the layout of rooms or other gameplay sections, with the world details etc.
- Take other maps or real-life places as examples and references (add these references to [[Reference Collection]]).
- Decide on 2D or 3D views.
- Draw as many maps as you like and don't shy away from throwing out some designs.
- Iterate over them and improve the detail of the maps.
- You can also add **Gates** that seal or open entries over time.
- It is possible to use **visual cues** and **symbols** to visually highlight important elements or give the player tips.


- An alternative approach of designing a map ([[Schell 2014 - A Book of Lenses]], chapter 21):
	- Draw a space (any shape)
	- Divide the space into irregular sections
	- Comes close to a real map because of it irregularity
### Output

- Many, many maps and fragments of maps.
- [[Map]], [[Sketch]], [[Drawing]]

### When to use it

- Explore the spatial relations and the limits and possibilities of the level.
- Find out where the character should start.
- Explore the story and narrative, where to put which hints, where to add a challenge.
- Decide on more story-based or open world gameplay.
- Place the NPCs.
- Find out how long the level will take to complete.

## Relevancy in the following processes
- [[Gamespace Prototyping]] Drawing a Map Step
- [[Game Development]] Pre-Production Step
- [[Iterative Map Design]]

## Applicability

- Essential for every game designer during the planning and designing phases.
- Useful for communicating with artists and setting the level's mood by adding details.
- A valuable reference for engineers to understand where to implement mechanics.
- Provides a good testing base and map for initial prototype levels.
- Remember, it's still a concept that may evolve over time.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros**:
- Effective planning.
- Incorporates artistic choices.
- Clarifies spatial relations.
- Precisely defines metrics.
  
**Cons**:
- Remains a conceptual stage.
- Requires the creation of multiple drawings.
- Subject to change over time.

## Relation with other Methods

- [[Nintendo Power Method]] since it's based on a map
- Should be part of [[Game Design Document]]
- [[Reward Schedule]] should be included when planning the layout of the level
- [[Mood Boards]] as aesthetic inspiration for the map's looks
- [[Reference Collection]] as direct references for drawing the map and filling it with life
- [[Behavior Diagram]]: Describes how a player or other game objects behave within the map and level
- [[Critical Path Analysis]] improves the map
- [[Massing]] models the game in 3D
- [[Molecule Diagram]] structures the map, just like a [[Proximity Diagram]]
- [[Symbols and Visual Language]] can be used in the map
