## Intent

- Structure your level with a story narrative that maintains player engagement.
- Achieve a balance between intense gameplay sequences and exploration to maintain player interest.
- Effectively communicate your creative vision with your team.

## Problem

### General

- Planning a level to align with a story narrative, such as the three-act structure, is essential to maintain your vision throughout production and connect it with other levels on a broader scale.
- Players may feel overwhelmed if a scene is too densely packed, or they may lose interest when nothing significant is happening.
- Ensuring that the tempo and rhythm of your game are fitting with the game and the player.
- Drawing parallels to music: An interesting music piece changes over time.

### Specific

- Creating a level with a boss fight and thrusting players directly into the battle can lead to discomfort, frustration, or anxiety.
- Maintaining tension at a constant level without variation can result in player boredom.
- Linearly increasing pacing may become too predictable.

## Approach/ Solution

- Utilize the three-act structure and document it on a timeline.
    - First Act: The setup of the plot.
    - Second Act: The confrontation.
    - Third Act: The resolution.

- Pacing consists of three core elements:
    - Intensity (combat is high intensity, exploration or puzzles are low intensity).
    - Variety (monotone levels are boring).
    - Time (if a level takes too long, players may not finish it).
    
- Think of pacing as a music piece: It includes elements like
    - Rhythm (the game's tempo).
    - Flow/Melody (variation in pacing).
    - Harmony (how gameplay and story elements work together).
    - Form (emphasis on big moments).
    - Timbre (the unique quality of gameplay mechanics).
    - Dynamics (intensity, enemy numbers, aggression).
    - Texture (complexity of gameplay).
      
- **Gameplay Beats**: Main events and activities in your level that maintain player interest.

## Application

### Input

- An idea of the narrative in your head.
- Knowledge about the level's story structure (e.g., three acts) and gameplay beats.
- Pen and paper or a digital tool to visualize your diagram.

### Application

- Create a visual level timeline by documenting the story structure on a timeline and adding gameplay beats. Use color-coding for specific recurring patterns in your level (e.g., tutorials in green). Add hard gates (Def.: Narrative sections that have to be triggered by the player to further advance in the level) to further structure your level.

- Represent your pacing on a line stretching across your story structure (three acts) on a timeline.
- Alternatively, represent pacing in boxes:

- Strive for non-monotonic pacing that keeps player attention while allowing for smooth level progression without losing tension.
- Vary your pacing; more pronounced differences between high and low pacing can create a dynamic and engaging experience or be overwhelming.
- Remember that every player has their own pace, unlike movies where pacing is linear and consistent for all viewers.
- Expect a fair amount of trial and error. Experiment with various approaches, discuss, and revise accordingly.
- Ensure that the pacing matches the overall tone of your game and aligns with other levels, considering both broad and specific connections.

#### Non-linear Pacing Diagrams

- Your level flow doesn't have to be linear; it can include alternative routes based on player decisions or specific trigger points.
- To control the overall pacing, divide the level areas into beats. Define and combine several linear pacing diagrams if necessary.

- In an open world, consider restricting areas to players, for example entry areas. This helps directing the pacing for the player, at least to a certain amount. 

#### X/Y axis Pacing Diagram

- Plot two variables against each other on an x and y axis to analyze their connection and how they work together
- For example, analyze how intense the **gameplay** becomes over **time**
- Sort the narrative in categories and analyze when these categories appear in the narrative over time and how high their intensity is

### When to use this method

- During the design phase when crafting your level.
- Provides a solid foundation for further level details and is beneficial to have established in advance.

### Relevant Roles using this model
- #roles/designer [[Designer]] #used-by/designer 
- #roles/writer [[Writer]] #used-by/writer 

### Output
- A [[Diagram]] or [[Graph]] that clearly illustrates the pacing of your level.
- A [[Timeline]] may also be used to represent a pacing diagram. See the example of an x/y axis pacing diagram.

## Relevancy in the following Processes:
- [[Game Development]] planning and designing step
- [[Combat Design]] utilizes a pacing diagram to define when a combat sequence will take place.
- [[Gamespace Prototyping]] when creating charts (second step) and drawing a map (third step)
- May help [[Iterative Map Design]] to define pacing in the level

## Applicability

- The output serves as an effective means of communicating your vision to the team.
- Easy to understand by everyone, fostering clarity in the level design process.
- Suitable for both agile and waterfall approaches, as it provides a fixed document for reference.
- Excellent for iteration but may need to be finalized once level building begins.
- Requires prior knowledge of gameplay beats to align with pacing.
- Complexities arise when considering alternate routes; non-linear pacing can be challenging to implement.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros**: 

- Easy to understand
- Fixed document that can be referenced to at any point
- Clear language that supports the process of level designing
- Quick work with a lot of impact

**Cons**:

- Might be too abstract if you don't define the gameplay beats beforehand
- Doesn't include the player's individual behavior and might not work out in the end (it's only on paper anyways)
- It's difficult to set pacing in an open world
