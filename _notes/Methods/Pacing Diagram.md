## Intent

- Layout your level with a story structure that keeps the player's attention
- Alternate between high packed intense gameplay and exploration, let the player breathe
- Communicate your vision with your team

## Problem

In General: 
- A level follows a story narrative (idea: three act structure). It's important to plan your level ahead of production to keep your intent through the whole level and connect it with other levels on a bigger scale.
- Players might feel too pressured when the scene is too packed or they lose interest when nothing is happening.
- getting "the tempo and the rhythm" of your game right
- comparison to music: An interesting music piece changes over time

Concrete: 
- create a level with a boss fight, pushing them directly into the fight will cause discomfort and frustration or anxiety
- keeping the tension on one level will cause boredom
- increasing the pacing linearly might be too predictable

## Approach/ Solution

- use the three-act structure and write it down on a timeline.
	- First act: 
	- Second Act: 
	- Third Act:

(Three-act-structure, https://www.worldofleveldesign.com/categories/wold-members-tutorials/peteellis/level-design-pacing-gameplay-beats-part1.php)

- Three core elements:
	- Intensity (combat is high intensity, exploration or puzzles low intensity)
	- Variety (monotone levels are boring)
	- Time (if a level takes too long people don't finish it)

- Think of pacing as a music piece: It includes a 
	- rhythm (tempo of the game), 
	- Flow/Melody (how monotone your pacing is or sudden it changes), Harmony (how the gameplay and story elements work together), 
	- the form (choruses are louder and require more attention just like big fights or moments in your story), 
	- Timbre (the instrument that is playing the note, the quality of the note -> transfers to the mechanics used in that Gameplay beat), 
	- Dynamics (how loud your beat is, how many enemies, how aggressive), 
	- Texture (how complex your gameplay is, try to keep it on a mangeable level)

- Gameplay Beats: main events and activities that are part of your level and that keep your story interesting

## Application

### Input

- an idea you have in your head
- knowledge about the story structure of the level (three-acts?) and gameplay beats
- pen and paper or a digital tool that helps visualizing your diagram

### Application (?)

- visual level timeline: write down the story structure on a timeline and add the gameplay beats. Color-code certain repeated patterns in your level. (e.g. Tutorials in green). Add hard-gates to further structure your level.

- Write your pacing in a line stretching over your story structure (three-acts?) on a timeline
- Can also be written in boxes:

  (TychoBolt 2020)
- Try to think of a non-monotonic pacing that keeps the attention of the player and that makes it easy to flow through your level without losing tension
- vary your pacing. more extreme differences between high and low pacing might create a more dynamic and interesting experience or it might be too much for your level.
- keep in mind the gameplay beats where the pacing increases and the exploration parts that allow the player to breathe
- also keep in mind that every player has their own pace, it's not like movies where the pacing is linear and everyone has the same experience
- much trial and error, try many approaches and discuss and remodel it
- match it with the overall tone of your game and connect it to other levels (from big overall to more specified)


### When to use this method

- #process/designing 
- designing your level, design phase
- good base for further details in your level, good to have it set beforehand
- 

### Relevant Roles using this model
- #roles/designer 
- [[Designer]] game Designer

### Output
- #medium/diagram 
- A diagram that clearly shows the pacing of your level
- #medium/timeline
- See example with x/y axis pacing diagram, it follows the flow of time

## Relevancy in the following Processes:
- ??
- [[Game Development]] designing step, can be applied to Games Engineering Designing step (still need a file for that)

## Applicability
- The output is a good way to communicate visions to your team
- everyone can understand since the visual language is easy to understand
- good in the design process and applicable in both agile and waterfall approaches since you have a set document in the end
- good to iterate over it but once you start building your level it should be fixed (?)
- you need to know your gameplay beats before so that you can match it with your pacing
- What if you have alternate routes? How will your pacing change then? -> non-linear pacing

### Pros and Cons

Pros: 
- easy to understand
- set document that can be referenced to at any point
- clear language that supports the process of level designing
- quick work with a lot of impact

Cons:
- might be too abstract if you don't define the gameplay beats beforehand
- doesn't include the player's individual behavior and might not work out in the end (it's only on paper anyways)
- it's difficult to set pacing in an open world

## Non-linear Pacing Diagrams
TODO

## Relevant Tools

- some [[Digital Diagram Tools]] 
- pen and paper
- [[Communication Tools]] like teams/slack
- [[Storage Tools]] or folder structure to put save your diagrams in
