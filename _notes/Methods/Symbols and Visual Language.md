also known as: Visual Design

## Classification
- #method 
- #medium/visual 
- #roles/designer #roles/artists 
- #used-by/designer #used-by/artist 
- #tools/digital #tools/non-digital 

## Intent
- Visually communicate intentions with the player
- Focus the player's attention
- Teaching the player (game mechanics)

## Problem

- As a designer, you want to find a way to show the player which mechanics can be used when (in and outside of a tutorial level)
- How do you guide a player through a puzzle when certain mechanics are needed at some points?
- How do you help players who are having a hard time navigating, climbing a building or adjusting to the difficulty level?

## Solution Approach

- Use prefabricated assets as symbols that repeat over the level whenever a certain mechanic is needed
- Guide the player through the level with visual cues
- The symbols can be used as teaching method:
	- Introduce them in the tutorials and early levels and connect them to a mechanic (e.g a questionmark block in Mario means you can jump against it and get a reward)
	- Repeating the symbol enforces the learning process

## Application

### Input
- A Map or level-in-progress (not necessary but good to have)
- Fixed decisions on the mechanics

### Application

- Create environmental symbols that guide the player through the level, give a hint to certain mechanics etc.
	- Each symbol has to be unique in its appearance and easily distinguishable from similar environment art
	- Each symbol has to be repeated so that the player learns what to use or what to expect when coming across this symbol
	  
- Introduce symbols used for teaching in first levels/ tutorial levels and repeat them to enforce the learning process

- Think about where to place the symbols and Visual Cues in the later levels
	- Consider making a schedule or [[Pacing Diagram]] only with visual cues
 
- Plan your level's puzzles and labyrinths with these symbols and visual cues
	- Place them strategically
	- Rule of Thirds: Divide the screen in three sections vertically and horizontally each. Place your elements on one of those divided lines to focus the player's attention on the element
		- e.g. Journey places the player character on the first vertical line, covers the bottom third with a sand dune and puts the mountain (the destination of the game) in the center to create a visually striking image:

		  (Journey game)
  
- Consult with the Artist team to create these assets
	- Clearly distinguish the symbols from other assets (e.g. consider making an interactable door 3D to let it stand out from the 2D background)
	- Use the basic color theory and harsh contrasts to let the asset stand out
	- Use the concept of framing (surrounding the important visual element with other elements that focus the player's attention on the important object, e.g. trees surrounding and framing a statue important to storytelling)

### Output
- The symbols and visual cues as prefabricated assets that can be used in the actual building of a level, [[Asset]]
- Possibly a schedule when to include which asset/visual cue, [[Timeline]]

### When to use it
- In the Game Development process when designing the level
- After you already decided on the mechanics
- When you think about the aesthetics of a level, too

### Relevant Roles using this model
- #roles/designer [[Designer]] #used-by/designer 
- #roles/artists [[Artist]] #used-by/artist 

## Relevancy in the following processes
- [[Game Development]] Pre-Production and Production step
- [[Iterative Map Design]] when refining the map
- [[Prototyping]] part of the prototype because it helps in enforcing the mechanics

## Applicability

- You need to find a balance between showing too much and not showing enough to keep the challenge od the game

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- Clearly communicate with the player
- Decreases frustration in the player when they know what to do
- Simplifies wayfinding because symbols can guide the player

Cons:
- If you don't make the symbols distinguishable, they can mix with the environment and create more frustration in the player
- Overengineering: Overloading the level with visual cues
- Finding a balance between helping the player too much and not helping them enough is hard

## Relation with other Methods
- [[Mood Boards]] help in finding the right aesthetic and communicating with the player through visuals
- [[Reference Collection]] can help in finding a distinguishable shape for the symbols
- [[Drawing a Map]] because the cues are part of the map
- [[Gym Scene]]: Test the symbols with the mechanics in a gym scene
- [[Pacing Diagram]] or [[Reward Schedule]] can be used as a bluebprint to plan the appearance of symbols and visual cues as well

## Examples

- Mario Tutorial Level introduces symbols and visual cues that are repeated over the whole game

- The climbable walls in Tomb Raider are introduced early in the game and somewhat distinguish themselves from other rocks
