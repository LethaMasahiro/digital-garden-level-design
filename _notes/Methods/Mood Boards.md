## Classification
#method 
#process/planning 
#medium/visual 
#medium/collection

## Intent
- transport a visual aesthetic or key you want in your game
- communicate your idea of a feature on a visual basis
- convey the mood (modus loci (? lol)) of your level

## Problem

### General

### Specific
- how to decide on which mood and aesthetic you want,
- how to communicate it in your team and create a shared vision of how your level should look like
- need a "communication medium" and "coordination medium" (Endrissat et al., 2016)
- Expand your horizon and enable your creativity and self-autonomy
- Find a point to start and yontinue working from

## Solution Approach

### General
- references are a great tool to explain your ideas through visual keys and already existent references
- get inspired by by games, art and real-life examples
- also just colors and abstract pictures help to solidify your vision
- Sometimes it's easier to have existing objects to base your creativity and vision on rather than working on something from scratch
- "Visual and material artifacts support creativity and coordination" (Endrissa et al., 2016)

### Specific

## Application

### Input
- Any visual data that fits your vision
- Can be from games, art, reallife, movie scenes, colors, ...
- e.g. snippets from the world of Pandora (Avatar) as inspiration for your own alien world, artwork from "Journey" (game) to help setting the mood of an isolated place, Greek architecture for a ruin dungeon in your game
- Allowed sources are all types of visual assets: Digital paintings, paintings, photographies, scribbles, concept images, blueprints, screenshots, games, videos, GIFs (and memes), materials, textures, colors, shapes, models, sounds, music, voices, dialogues (also audio cues?)

### Application
- Collect all the visual data and put them together in a folder, collage, general collection
- You can mix them together and take snippets out of the data or leave them as they are
- Store them in a place that is easily accessible for your team and think about collaboration, do you want others to participate in the collection? Would you rather show and present your ideas?

### Output
- Mood board that sets a certain tone, aesthetic, mood, easily communicates your idea through visuals

### When to use it
- Share your vision
- Coordinate and collaborate on a shared vision
- Enable your creativity
- Planning process and always refer back to it to know what your initial idea is

### Relevant Roles using this model
- #roles/designer [[Designer]] #used-by/designer 
- #used-by/artist [[Artist]] (also created by designer?)

## Relevancy in the following processes
- [[Game Development]] in the planning process
- [[Prototyping]] What you want to create

## Applicability
- As coordination tool: Set the scene, provide a direction you want to go in aesthetically, use as reference
- As creative freedom: Get ideas, interpretations are different depending on the person interpreting it, get inspired, express yourself and find the signature aesthetic of your game
- But it's only a reference, don't copy a game 1:1! Let yourself get inspired by it rather than getting stuck on already existent material (that's why you collect lots of reference)

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- Starting somewhere (easier to start with existent material)
- Expanding your creativity
- communication and coordination tool (artists and designers have a direction)

Cons:
- not feasible, nothing you can test
- just artistic direction and creativity, nothing practical
- limited on visual and audible cues (actually not, you can also take books as part of a mood board)
