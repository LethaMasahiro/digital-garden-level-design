## Intent

- Convey a visual aesthetic or key concept for your game.
- Communicate your feature ideas visually.
- Convey the mood or atmosphere of your level.

## Problem

- How does one decide on the mood and aesthetic for your level?
- How to effectively communicate and share your vision with your team?
- There's a need for a communication and coordination medium.
- You want to expand your creative horizons and foster autonomy.
- You want to find a starting point and continue your work effectively.

## Solution Approach

- Use references as a tool to express your ideas through visual cues and existing examples.
- Find inspiration in games, art, and real-life references.
- Colors and abstract images can help solidify your vision.
- Utilize existing objects as a foundation for your creativity and vision.
- "Visual and material artifacts support creativity and coordination." ([Endrissat et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296315004270))

## Application

### Input

- Any visual data that aligns with your vision.
- Sources can include games, art, real-life imagery, movie scenes, colors, and more.
- For example, snippets from the world of Pandora (Avatar, 2009) can inspire your own alien world, artwork from "Journey" (2012) can set the mood for an isolated place, Greek architecture can influence a ruin dungeon in your game.
- Allowable sources encompass various visual assets: Digital paintings, traditional art, photographs, sketches, concept art, blueprints, screenshots, games, videos, GIFs, materials, textures, colors, shapes, models, sounds, music, voices, and dialogues (including audio cues).

### Application

- Collect all the visual data and compile it into a folder, collage, or a general collection.
- You can mix, edit, or leave the visual data as they are.
- Store them in an easily accessible location for your team, considering whether others should participate in the collection process or if you prefer to present your ideas.

### Output

- A mood board that conveys a specific tone, aesthetic, and mood, effectively communicating your vision through visuals.
- [[Collection]]

### When to Use It

- When you want to convey and share your vision.
- When you need to coordinate and collaborate on a shared aesthetic and vision.
- To spark creativity and enable a collaborative exploration of the game's visual direction.
- Throughout the planning process, and as a reference to maintain your initial concept.

## Applicability

- As a coordination tool: Define the scene, provide an aesthetic direction, and offer references.
- For creative freedom: Gather ideas, invite diverse interpretations, seek inspiration, express your vision, and discover your game's signature aesthetic.
