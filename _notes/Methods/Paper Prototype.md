## Intent

- Speed up the prototyping process, enhancing productivity.
- Identify and address issues at an earlier production stage.
- Save time in digital prototyping iterations.

## Problem

- Prototyping is a crucial process for testing designs and ideas, but it can be slow.
- Efficiently progressing through the development cycle can be challenging, particularly when digital prototyping consumes a big amount of important resources like time.

## Solution Approach

- Begin your game design as a non-digital board game to test the gameplay before you invest time and money in digital prototyping.

## Application

### Input

- Game ideas and designs that can be tested and documented on paper.
- A scoring system that can be adapted to a board game format.

### Application

- Transform your game into a board game.
- Create player tokens and other assets essential to the game.
- Determine how to translate game mechanics into board game rules.
    - Convert digital turn-based combat into non-digital turn-based combat involving players or the game itself.
    - For randomization, place objects/numbers in a bag for players to draw, or use dice.
    - Sketch your game map on paper and allow player tokens to move across it.
    - Use a clock for time measurement and counters for tracking in time-based levels.
- Test the board game prototype with various players, focusing on identifying flaws in the rule set and mechanics.
    - Evaluate the balance of game mechanics.
    - Assess the enjoyment factor.
    - Analyze the map's size and level of engagement.
- Apply the lessons learned from the paper prototype to the digital development of your game.

### Output

- Analysis of the paper [[Prototype]] (a board game) that can be incorporated into the digital prototype. Should be documented in a [[Document]].
- May include [[Drawing]]s and [[Sketch]]es.

### When to Use It

- When time savings are a priority.
- When involving multiple players early in development without establishing technical multiplayer functionality.
- As part of the [[Gamespace Prototyping]] process.

### Relevant Roles Using This Model

- #roles/designer [[Designer]] #used-by/designer
- #roles/tester [[Roles/Tester]]

## Relevancy in the Following Processes

- [[Gamespace Prototyping]]
- [[Game Development]] in the production phase.

## Applicability

- Suitable when an existing ruleset and a clear game vision are already in place.
- Most effective in the early stages of production and prototyping.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros**:

- Early identification of problems.
- Efficient problem-solving in design.
- Time-saving benefits.

**Cons**:

- Limited impact on technical and artistic development.
- Requires resources and player involvement to test the prototype accordingly.
- Translating digital rules to paper can be challenging, and score tracking may pose difficulties.

## Relation with Other Methods

- [[Drawing a Map]] because a map of your level may be required.
- [[Lenses]]: Part of #16 The Lens of Risk Mitigation.
- [[Game Design Document]] to document the results and findings of your prototype.

## Examples

- **Tetris as a Paper Prototype**
    
    - Create geometric pieces resembling Tetris shapes and place them in a bag.
    - Draw the game board on paper.
    - Have someone draw shapes and slide them down the board.
    - Apply the rotation and shifting rules while sliding the shapes.
    - To clear lines, either mentally visualize or pause the game to remove pieces.
    - Track scores by recording them.
      
      
- **Halo as a Paper Prototype**
    
    - Create game characters and assign one player to control them.
    - Designate another player as the enemy.
    - Draw a map and position the characters on it.
    - Establish turn-based rules for movement and combat.
        - Simulate shots using a metronome, allowing one shot per metronome tick when an enemy is in sight.
        - This system introduces a slow-motion effect, enabling analysis of gameplay elements.
