## Intent
- Make the process of prototyping faster and more productive
- Discover problems sooner
- Save digital prototyping loops

## Problem

- Prototyping is an important process to test out designs and ideas and find problems, but sometimes it's not fast enough
- You would like to loop through the development process as efficient as possible but don't know how since digital prototyping sometimes takes a lot of resources

## Solution Approach

- Design the game as a board game first

## Application

### Input
- Ideas and designs of the game that can already be tested and put on paper
- A scoring system that can be transfered to board games

### Application
- Make a board game out of your game
- Create player figures and other objects for important assets
- Decide on how to transfer the mechanics to the rules of a board game
	- Digital turn-based combat can be turned into a non-digital turn-based combat against players or the game itself
	- For random generator, put objects/numbers in a bag and let a person draw one. Or use dices
	- Draw your map on paper and let the player figures move on the map
	- Use a clock to measure time and use counters if your level is time-based
- Test the built level with different players and look for flaws especially in the rule set and mechanics
	- Are the mechanics balanced?
	- Is it fun to play?
	- Is the map big enough and interesting?
- Apply these findings to the digital development of your game

### Output
- Analysis of the paper prototype (which is a board game) that can be applied to the digital prototype

### When to use it
- When you want to save time
- When you want to include multiple players early without having established a multiplayer on a technical basis
- Part of the [[Prototyping]] process

### Relevant Roles using this model
- #roles/designer [[Designer]] #used-by/designer 
- #roles/tester  [[Roles/Tester]]  

## Relevancy in the following processes
- [[Prototyping]]
- [[Game Development]] production phase

## Applicability

- Can only be used when you already have an existing ruleset and a vision on how the game is supposed to look like
- Applicable in the early stages of production and prototyping

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- Problems are discovered earlier
- Find design problems efficiently
- Saves time

Con:
- Doesn't contribute to the technical and artistical development
- Needs resources and players
- It can be difficult to transfer the digital rules on paper and scores can be difficult to track

## Relation with other Methods
- [[Drawing a Map]] because you might need a map of your level on paper

## Examples

- Tetris as a Paper Prototype
	- Cut out little geometric pieces in the shape of Tetris stones and throw them in a bag
	- Draw the level as the board
	- Let someone else draw the shapes and slide them down the board
	- Try to apply the rotation and shifting rules to the board while continuously sliding the shapes down
	- To delete a line, either imagine it in your head or pause the game and cut the pieces
	- Track your scores by writing it down
	  
- Halo as a Paper Prototype
	- Create the game characters and let one player play these characters
	- Let another player play the enemies
	- Draw a map and put the characters on the map
	- Either make turn-based rules how to move and shoot
		- A metronome simulator that ticks in regular intervals equals one shot, so the players are allowed to shoot once per metronome tick when the enemy is in sight
		- With this system, everything will feel like slow motion which gives time to think about what is working and what needs more work
