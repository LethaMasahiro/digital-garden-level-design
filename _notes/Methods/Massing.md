## Classification

- #medium/visual 
- #roles/designer 
- #used-by/designer #used-by/artist 
- #tools/digital #tools/non-digital 

## Intent
- Get a sense for space and the objects within the space
- Support the logic and function of a building or space

## Problem

### General
- In Architecture, one wants to know the feel and logic of a space
	- Is a room large or small, hidden or open, light or dark?
	- What is the relation of two rooms? Are the close together or far apart?
	- Is one wall related to another wall?

### Specific
- The same as for architecture: You want to know the logic behind a structure or space like a building, put the rooms and the overall layout into relation and understand the feeling of the structure or space
- Also ask yourself the question: Will players use the rooms/Buildings and when will they use it?

## Solution Approach

### General
- Divide the building/space into multiple rooms/sections and define their purpose
- Play around with the layout of the level until you have a coherent structure that makes sense for people who are using the building/space

### Specific
- Same as General

## Application

### Input
- A three-dimensional building or space that you want to understand and possibly remodel

### Application

- Three methods of massing:
	- Dimensional: Rotate, shape or scale the object on the three dimensions
	- Additive: Make more complicated shapes by combining simple shapes
	- Substractive: Substract a simple shape from a complex shape. Can increase the interest of players if they are confronted with unusual objects or rooms or spaces
	  
- Make a hierarchy on the importance of the masses that you are analyzing. A complex unusual shape draws more attention and can be made the central focus point of the player.
  
- Analyze the "readability" of your structure. A composition of many simple shapes has a higher readability over a composition of many complex shapes. Combining one complex shapes with many simple shapes can draw more attention to the complex shape.
- Play with proportions and the center of gravity:
	- Thickness and Weight: Thicker and heavier objects have a natural focus on them
	- Corners: Play with sharp and round edges. Rounded and complex corners draw more attention compared to simple corners. Break up structures with open corners.
	  
- ##### Landscape Design
	- Shape the land and landscapes to support the flow of the level
	- Take nature into account: On a mountain, how's the weather on different heights? Where do trees grow and when do they stop? Can it be rainy on one side of the mountain and sunny on the other side? Where does the water flow?
	- Landscape Sculpting workflow:
		- Layout: Draw a simple diagram of the landscape with labels
		- Blockout: Sculpt rough shapes for the landscape, with attention to flow and scale
		- Metrics: Measure travel times, heights, and traversable ramps / slopes
		- Art pass: Sculpt and paint smaller details, apply set dressing
	- Also think about the overall climate within that landscape, does it change?
	- Where do you place trees? Can they serve as walls?

- ##### Path Design
	- Path Types:
		- Ledge Paths: open on one side, closed on the other, e.g. hiking trails
		- Cuttings: closed on both sides, e.g. between mountains
		- Ridge paths: Open on both sides and raised up, e.g. trail on top of a mountain
		- Switchbacks/ zig zag paths: Alteration between the top three paths, not naturally occuring
		  
- ##### Composition
	- Visually organize your level
	- Place your objects according to these dimensions:
		- Height: What is their height relation?
		- Density/spread: How close are they placed?
		- Orientation: Are they facing each other?
		- Shape: Are a lot of rectangular things close to each other or do you vary the shapes?
	- Use landmarks as special points of interest that look memorable
	- Use Vistas that allow an overview over the next scene or space 
	- Make use of sightlines (empty open space that allows to view into the next space, vistas are sightlines) and cover (protect the player from being spotted and from attacks)

### Output
- Either a prototype or just models in the early stages of prototyping (e.g. [[Blockout]])
- A remodeled version of your level taking all the above points into account

### When to use it
- When you want to understand three-dimensional spatial compositions
- When you want to make the space more more interesting by using different compositions of objects
- Harmonizes with prototyping

### Relevant Roles using this model
- #roles/designer [[Designer]] #used-by/designer 
-  [[Artist]] #used-by/artist 

## Relevancy in the following processes
- [[Prototyping]] early stages
- [[Combat Design]] to decide where to put vistas and covers
- [[Iterative Map Design]] because it defines the map of the level in a certain way

## Applicability
- Use it when you already have sketches of your level at least, should also have three-dimensional objects and spaces already or at least have an idea what to put in the level
- Very detailed when it comes to planning how you would like to make use of the space
- There's a lot to play with and a lot to change according to the players' needs and your vision

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- Detailed
- A lot you can do with this method
- Fit for playtesting too

Cons:
- Technical, you also need a program that allows you to build shapes
- Might take a lot of time and effort
- 

## Relation with other Methods
- [[Drawing a Map]] on a more technical basis and reshaping the map according to different parameters
- [[Level Parti]] is a step earlier because Massing takes the shapes defined in this method
- [[Gym Scene]] builds on massing
- [[Nintendo Power Method]] and [[Critical Path Analysis]] analyzes which shapes and rooms are important
- [[Symbols and Visual Language]] can be built by massing and focused on by the spatial composition in massing

## Relevant Tools
- [[Digital Design Tools]] to generate 3D shapes and make blueprints of landscape objects that take to much time to design one by one, a 3D program like Blender
- [[Non-digital Design Tools]] like Sketching and measuring in the first steps
