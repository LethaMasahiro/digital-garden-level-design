## Classification

- #medium/graph #medium/visual #medium/diagram 
- #roles/designer 
- #used-by/designer #used-by/artist #used-by/engineers 
- #tools/digital #tools/non-digital 

## Intent
- Same as Molecule DIagrams
	- Structure the level in a more detailed language-coded way
	- Spatial overview of the level
	- Know where to put level objects, gates, fights and where to set your gameplay beats and story points in a spatial sense
	- Create dynamic between story and space
- Organize space requirements together with space allocation

## Problem

### General
- Describe spatial relations with their individual meanings as well (e.g. describe their size or importance)

### Specific
- Connect game spaces within the level by their importance
- Describe the size of the game spaces

## Solution Approach

- Create a [[Methods/Molecule Diagram]] but transfer meaning with the size of the bubbles and links as well
- Use all tips from the Molecule Diagram but give the diagram more meaning

## Application

### Input
- Decision which gamespaces you have in your level and what you want to give additional information for
- Pen and Paper or digital tool
- Graph theory knowledge

### Application

- Draw a Molecule Diagram
  
- But adapt the sizes of the nodes according to
	- The size of the game space according to spatial metrics (e.g. rooms of 50m² are drawn bigger than rooms with 30m²)
	- The importance of the gamespace to the level
	  
- Thicken the connections between the nodes according to how important their conenction is
	- Use different line types to symbolize if one space can be reached by the other (normal line) only seen from the other (dashed lines). Be creative about it and only draw what you want to communicate
	  
- Use the tips from Molecule Diagrams
### Output
- A proximity [[Diagram]]
- The interpretation of the diagram (e.g. a [[Map]])

### When to use it
- #process/planning 
- #process/designing 
- When you would like to give the Molecule Diagram extra meaning

### Relevant Roles using this model
-  #roles/designer  [[Designer]] #used-by/designer 
-  [[Artist]] #used-by/artist 
-  [[Engineer]] #used-by/engineers 

## Relevancy in the following processes
- [[Prototyping]]
- [[Game Development]] Planning and designing
- [[Combat Design]]

## Applicability
- see [[Methods/Molecule Diagram]] with more details

### Pros and Cons
- see [[Methods/Molecule Diagram]]

## Relation with other Methods
- closely related with [[Methods/Molecule Diagram]]
- [[Drawing a Map]] as an end product after drawing the diagram

## Examples

- One example of transfering a Proximity Diagram to a Map
